    <h2> Nicolette </h2>
        <p> Hello, I'm Nicolette! Pianist, vocalist, and amateur coder! </p>
        <p>  Building this website took a lot of troubleshooting and patience! While we now successfully have a working page it took a lot of fiddling around and making tiny adjustments! We faced most of our problems when we were all working on the page at the same time, especially when it came to fetching things from GitHub Desktop to make sure we had the most up-to-date version of the index.html page. Additionally, as expected when learning a new language we had many issues with our syntax ( using correct html) that ran us into other problems such as our code not showing up! </p>
